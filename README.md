   Visit our site here! [Aqua site] (https://nerdoflinux.github.io/index.html)
   Aqua is currently in Alpha stages and is still yet being developed.
   Aqua is currently only tested in Ubuntu and Mac OS, but should work with most debian based operating systems.
   Note: Aqua is not a true assistant yet.

   cd Aqua-cpp; make  

# <h2> Using Aqua on Windows: </h2>
  Please note that we the developers are no longer officially supporting windows. If you are on Windows though please install and or use a adaquate C++ compiler, then run the Aqua.cpp File. Some features may not work as they use the linux shell.
 
 
# <h2> News: </h2> <br>
   The Python Aqua version (Aqua.py & Aqua3.py) is no longer being actively developed!.

# <h2> Notes: </h2> <br>
   If you are still planning on using the Python version of Aqua (stable) please use Aqua3.py for Python3 and Aqua.py for Python2.7.12.

#We currently do not have time to actively add features to Aqua. Please contact us if you would like to help.
