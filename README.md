# Aqua
If you are using python 3 run the AI3.py.
 Aqua is still in early Alpha stages (still being developed) and is not a true assistant yet.
 
 <b> To run this program please type bash setup.sh (in terminal) if on linux or Mac. <br></b>
 <b> If you are on Windows please install a compiler (Recommended: Windows visual studio Community 2015)</b>
 <br><b> The Python Aqua version is no longer being actively developed, but is stable.</b>
